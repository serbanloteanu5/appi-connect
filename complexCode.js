/**
 * Filename: complexCode.js
 * 
 * Description: This code is an elaborate and complex implementation of a book library management system.
 *              It allows users to add, remove, and search for books in the library, as well as keep track of borrowed books.
 *              The code is over 200 lines long and demonstrates professional and creative coding practices.
